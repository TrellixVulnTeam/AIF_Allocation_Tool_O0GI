# ICS Place Based Allocation Tool 

This project is a tool built in Python to assist Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) to perform need based allocation based on defined place. It uses the most recently produced GP Registered Practice Populations as well as the weighted populations calculated from the Allocation model for each of its components.

The tool has been built using Streamlit, a Python app framework that can be used to create web apps. It can be installed by using the package manager pip. 

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

The tool is deployed from a public GitHub repository using Streamlit's cloud service. 

More information about Streamlit can be found from the link below: 
https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/

## Usage

Full instructions for using the tool can be found in the user guide. The tool allows 'place' to be defined in an ICS as a cluster of GP practices. This allows place to be flexibly defined, whether that is as GP practices in the same Primary Care Network (PCN), Local Authority or that feed into the same Secondary services for example, that is at the discretion of the ICS.
